# Rust solution for AOC 2023
This folder contains a cargo project for each completed AOC day (named `day{num}`).

Note that in case you want to run the projects, you want to be running them from the `day{num}` cwd using the command `cargo run --bin part{1 or 2}`. You might also want to change the input files named `part1.txt` and `part2.txt`.
